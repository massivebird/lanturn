# Lanturn

Lanturn is a website connectivity monitor written in Rust ðŸ¦€

Lanturn offers a simple dashboard that lets you quickly check if your internet â€” or one of your favorite sites â€” is up or down.

## Building

To manually build the project, you must first [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once you have Rust installed, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/massivebird/lanturn
cd lanturn
cargo run # runs unoptimized build
```

> `cargo run`'s build phase will tell you if you need to install other dependencies such as `pkg-config` and `libssl-dev`.

### Nix flake

If you're using Nix, you can add the following to your flake's `inputs`:

```nix
inputs = {
  # ...

  lanturn = {
    url = "github:massivebird/lanturn";
    inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
  };

  # ...
}
```

Then, add the following to your `environment.systemPackages`:

```nix
environment.systemPackages = [
  # ...
  inputs.lanturn.packages.${pkgs.system}.default
  # ...
]
```

## Configuration

Lanturn reads from a config file at `$HOME/.config/lanturn/config.yaml`.

Use the following as a template:

```yaml
# $HOME/.config/lanturn/config.yaml

sites: # All websites go under here.
  github:                      # A site "label." This can be whatever you want!
    name: "GitHub"             # Human-readable site name.
    url: "https://github.com"  # Site URL.
  steam:
    name: "Steam"
    url: "https://steampowered.com"
  google:
    name: "Google"
    url: "https://google.com"
  habbo:
    name: "Habbo Hotel"
    url: "https://www.habbo.com"
  canvas:
    name: "Canvas"
    url: "https://canvas.emich.edu"
  emich:
    name: "My Emich"
    url: "https://my.emich.edu"
```
